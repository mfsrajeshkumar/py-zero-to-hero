File handling:
------------------
--> A file is a container in a computer system for storing data.
--> Data is permanently stored


Project Level requirement:
Learn well about excel, csv, pdf file reading and writing (Recommended check important available packages)
Types of files:
-------------------
--> text
--> binary

Opening  a file:
----------------
--> open: returns a file handle
--> In order to perform any kind of operations on file first we open it
f = open("name.txt")
type(f)
f.closed # Return True if file is closed else False
f.read() # To read the file
f.close() # To close the file


#### File operations in python######
Modes of opening a file
1. 'r': read only
2. 'w': write only
3. 'a': appending data at the end of file
4. 'wt': write text
5. 'wb': write binary
6. 'rb': read binary
7. 'rt': read text


f = open("name.txt", "w")
f.write("I am writable now") 
# This will return length of characters which will be passed in write functionIn this case 18
f.close()

##### with open #####
--> Most common way to perform operation on files
--> It closes the file after performing operations

with is a context manager (Learn more about context manager)
with open("name.txt") as f:
    print(f.read())

f.closed # True

with open("name.txt", "w) as f:
    f.write("hey i am writable")

#####Writing a file#####
Writing in a file
--> You can write both text and binary file
--> You can either write or append in a file


# We are creating new file here
with open("new.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hey new file created")


# Write in existing file
with open("new.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("This is the updated content of our file \n")
    f.write("This is a new line")

##### Read #####
--> using read() method we can read a file 
--> It opens in read only format
read(): reads the whole data
read(l): reads data of length l
tell(): tells you about the position of file handle
seek(): it helps to re position your file handle
readlines(): reads data line by line
readline(): reads data line by line

##### handling binary file(non-text file) #####
--> To read binary data we open file in "rt" mode
--> To write binary data we open file in "wt" mode


with open("rj.jpeg", "rb") as f:
    data = f.read()  # b'..............'

    with open("rj_copy.jpeg", "wb") as d:
        d.write(data)

##### Append ######
with open("name.txt", "a") as f:
    f.write("This is appended data")
