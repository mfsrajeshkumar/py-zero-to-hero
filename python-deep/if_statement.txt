Q1.
what is suite here
The if statementÂ¶
The if statement is used for conditional execution:

if_stmt ::=  "if" assignment_expression ":" suite
             ("elif" assignment_expression ":" suite)*
             ["else" ":" suite]

In Python, a "suite" refers to a group of statements that are indented under a certain control structure or block.

For the if statement syntax you provided:
if condition:
    # This is a suite of statements
    statement1
    statement2
    # More statements...
elif another_condition:
    # Another suite of statements
    statement3
    statement4
    # More statements...
else:
    # Yet another suite of statements
    statement5
    statement6
    # More statements...
Here, each suite is a block of code associated with a particular condition in the if statement. The suite consists of one or more statements that are executed if the associated condition evaluates to True. The indentation (typically four spaces or a tab) is crucial in Python because it defines the boundaries of the suite. The indentation level determines which statements belong to which suite and which control structure they are associated with.
